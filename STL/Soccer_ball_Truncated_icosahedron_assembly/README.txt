# Summary

A friend of mine is coming to visit, a fellow mathematician, and I wanted to print him something mathematical as I gift. I had this idea of making an archimedean solid that you could assemble. I realized over the weekend that if the connections are perpendicular to the opposing faces then the ball should resist coming apart once it is fully assembled - with no gluing necessary. I printed it as soon as I got home and was very satisfied with the result :) The truncated icosahedron is one of my favorite polyhedra and since it is also the classical football ("soccer ball") pattern I decided to print the pentagons (5-sides) in black and the hexagons (6-sides) in white.
