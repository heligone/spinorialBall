## Introduction

The spinorial ball is LED gyro-Ball powered by an internal battery, whose faces change colors when it is rotated.

You need to turn it twice 360 around any axis so that the configuration gets back to itself.
Turn it once and it becomes the opposite of itself

The Mathematical machinery are detailed in this ARXIV article.
